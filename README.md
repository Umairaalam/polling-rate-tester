# Polling Rate Tester (Mouse & Keyboard)

This repository documents simple, browser-based tools that help users check real mouse and keyboard polling rate (Hz).

Polling rate shows how often an input device sends data to a computer every second. A higher polling rate can reduce input delay and improve responsiveness, depending on hardware and system limits.

## Online Polling Rate Tools

These tools work directly in your browser and do not require installation:

## What Is Polling Rate?

Polling rate is measured in Hertz (Hz).  
For example:
- 125 Hz = updates every 8 ms  
- 500 Hz = updates every 2 ms  
- 1000 Hz = updates every 1 ms  

Gamers, designers, and power users often test polling rate to confirm actual device performance instead of relying only on manufacturer specifications.

## Notes on Accuracy

Results may vary based on:
- Operating system
- Browser focus
- USB port type
- Wired vs wireless connection

These tools provide practical real-world measurements, not laboratory-grade benchmarks.
